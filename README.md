# Rock-Mine-Prediction

This is a binary classification problem and depending on several features the target value is either rock or mine.
All the labels are cleaned and EDA stuff has been done. Then, KNN and LogisticRegression algorithms applied to the 
data. Best accuracy was with KNeighborsClassifier as it seems in accuracy score and confusion matrix.
